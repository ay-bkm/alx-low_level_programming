# C - Structures, typedef Tasks README

This repository contains C source files demonstrating the usage of structures and typedef in C programming. The tasks focus on enhancing understanding of these concepts. Below is a summary of the tasks and key guidelines:

## Tasks

### 0. Poppy
- Define a `struct dog` with `name`, `age`, and `owner`.

### 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself
- Implement `init_dog` to initialize a `struct dog`.

### 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad
- Create `print_dog` to print elements of a `struct dog`.

### 3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read
- Define `dog_t` as a new name for `struct dog`.

### 4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of
- Write `new_dog` to create a new instance of `dog_t`.

### 5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg
- Develop `free_dog` to free memory for a `dog_t` structure.
