# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C - More malloc, free

Welcome to this repository showcasing advanced C programs that delve into the intricacies of memory allocation and freeing using dynamic memory allocation functions like `malloc`, `free`, and more. These programs are designed to help you master the art of memory manipulation, enabling you to create, manage, and optimize memory usage in C.

## Contents

Explore the following programs to enhance your understanding of dynamic memory allocation:

1. **0-malloc_checked.c**: Learn how to allocate memory using `malloc`, and ensure robust error handling to terminate the process if allocation fails. This program demonstrates the importance of memory allocation checks.

2. **1-string_nconcat.c**: Dive into string concatenation with a twist. This program showcases the creation of a new string by combining two strings while limiting the length of the second string to a specified number of characters.

3. **2-calloc.c**: Discover the power of `calloc`, a function that allocates memory for an array and initializes the memory to zero. This program exemplifies the creation of a memory block with zero-initialized elements.

4. **3-array_range.c**: Explore the dynamic creation of an array of integers that spans a specified range. This program demonstrates the flexibility of dynamic memory allocation in creating arrays of varying sizes.

5. **100-realloc.c**: Unlock the ability to reallocate memory blocks using `realloc`. This program guides you through the process of resizing an allocated memory block, copying content, and optimizing memory usage.

6. **101-mul.c**: Take a leap into advanced memory manipulation by writing a program that multiplies two positive numbers. This program showcases complex memory handling and mathematical operations.
