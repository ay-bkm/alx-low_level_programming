## Description

Welcome to the advanced tasks of the **0x0F. C - Function Pointers** project! In this project, you will explore the concept of function pointers in C programming. Through these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of function pointers, their usage, and their application in various contexts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following concepts without needing to reference external resources:

- Function pointers: What they are and how to use them
- The purpose and structure of function pointers
- The role of function pointers in the virtual memory
