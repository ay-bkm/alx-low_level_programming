# ALX Low-Level Programming - Memory Allocation and Freeing

This repository contains a set of C programs that demonstrate the concepts of memory allocation and freeing using dynamic memory allocation functions like `malloc`, `free`, and `strdup`. These programs cover various tasks that involve creating, manipulating, and managing memory in C.

## Contents

1. `0-create_array.c`: Creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.
2. `1-strdup.c`: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory containing a copy of the input string.
3. `2-str_concat.c`: Concatenates two strings and returns a newly allocated space in memory.
4. `3-alloc_grid.c`: Returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers, with each element initialized to 0.
5. `4-free_grid.c`: Frees a 2-dimensional grid created by `alloc_grid`.
6. `100-argstostr.c`: Concatenates all arguments of the program into a single string, each argument followed by a newline character.
7. `101-strtow.c`: Splits a string into words (substrings separated by spaces) and returns an array of strings.
